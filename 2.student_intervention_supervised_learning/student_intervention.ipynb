    "1. Decision Trees\n",
    "    - One real life application includes the use of automatic induction of decision trees in diagnosis to analyze Sudden Infant Death syndrome in the field of Medicine. (P.A.D. WILKS AND M.J. ENGLISH. Accurate segmentation of respiration waveforms from infants enabling identification and classification of irregular breathing patterns. Medical Engineering and Physics, 16(1):19--23, January 1994)\n",
    "    - Pros of decision trees include the interpretability, compared to models such as NN. Another is its applicable for both continuous and discrete inputs. Works very well when you want to rapidly see the outcomes of a classifier as there are less fine tuning to worry about.\n",
    "    - Cons of decision trees include the proneness to overfitting the training data. It works poorly when you don't prune the tree, or when the variance of the data may be very big\n",
    "    - It is a small dataset with a mixture of categorical and continuous inputs and theres a lot of room for analysis to see if the results matched intuition gained from looking at the inputs. So Decision Trees should be an adequate candidate for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SVM\n",
    "    - Often used in text and image classifications (Barghout, Lauren. \"Spatial-Taxon Information Granules as Used in Iterative Fuzzy-Decision-Making for Image Segmentation.\" Granular Computing and Decision-Making. Springer International Publishing, 2015. 285-318.)\n",
    "    - Pros of SVM include its reduced sensitivity to overfitting. It can also utilize both continuous and categorical, and Kernels allow the model to be very versatile and performs rather well in high dimensional space\n",
    "    - Cons include slower computation times and is very inefficient to train. So would not work very efficiently where there are a lot of training examples\n",
    "    - Small training data size, and has both categorical and continuous inputs. So is also an adequate candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Logistic Regression\n",
    "    - Used to predict whether a patient has a given disease given biometric and demographic characteristics (Truett, J; Cornfield, J; Kannel, W (1967). \"A multivariate analysis of the risk of coronary heart disease in Framingham\". Journal of chronic diseases. 20 (7): 511–24)\n",
    "    - Pros of Logistic Regression include robustness to noise, reduced proneness to overfitting, and also the output can be interpreted as a probability.\n",
    "    - Cons of Logistic Regression include potential high bias and cannot predict continuous outcomes\n",
    "    - Discrete outcome, decent amout of features, potential noise in data make Logistic Reg an adequate candidate."

Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Really the difference between SVM or logistic regressions is marginal, and since SVM can be derived from logistic regression, both models would work fine with this dataset, but since this is a small training set, and SVM maybe overkill, and since we have limited resources and logistic regression would scale better, we can go with logistic regression."

    "Given the data about students who have previously attended the school, we can predict whether or not a current student will pass or fail in the near future. Features such as student age, family occupation, family size and number of absence days, we can train a model that can predict the outcome of graduation. We will be using a model called logistic regression, which takes into account the past features mentioned above, and trains the model with the outcome that these students in the past have had. It then calculates the probability and decides if a student will pass or fail.\n",

    "How logistic regression works is by taking all the features and putting emphasis on different features according to how impactful they are to the final answer, and squashes the result so that all the data points lie between 0, and 1. so that a boundary can be drawn so that if a certain student obtains a value as a result of the model between 0 and 1, we can know if the student will likely fail or pass given the status quo, and can intervene to make sure that that student will be able to pass and eventually graduate. This is a computationally simpler model which would take less resources, and can be scaled up in the future when more data points are included with ease."
